To make Tinaa docs, in SBCL on Saraswati:

  (require :fset)
  (require :tinaa)
  (tinaa:document-system :asdf-system :fset "/home/gyro/Common-Lisp.net/FSet/Tinaa-Doc/")


Still to do:

( ) Finish release notes, add to WWW dir, and upload
( ) At least test in LispWorks, CLISP, and ECL
( ) Update home page and upload
(x) One bug fix (at least) is in darcs but not svn yet
( ) Make tarball, sign, and upload
